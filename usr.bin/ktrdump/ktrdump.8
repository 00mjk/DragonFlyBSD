.Sh NAME
.Nm ktrdump
.Nd print kernel ktr trace buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl acfinpqrstx
.Op Fl N Ar execfile
.Op Fl M Ar corefile
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to dump the contents of the kernel ktr trace buffer.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl N Ar execfile"
.It Fl a
Print all fields.  Implies all print options.
.It Fl c
Print the CPU number that each entry was logged from.
.It Fl f
Print the file and line number that each entry was logged from.
.It Fl i
Print the ID string field, identifying the facility being logged.
.It Fl n
.Nm
normally tries to translate the caller fields and (when easily parsed)
trace arguments into symbols.  This option forces hex values to be
displayed instead.  This option will also cause relative timestamps to
be displayed as TSC timestamps rather then converted to microseconds.
.It Fl p
Print the trace data.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode; do not print the column header.
.It Fl r
Print relative timestamps in microseconds, rather than absolute TSC
timestamps.
.It Fl s
Attempt to merge the KTR logs for all cpus into a single time-sorted
log.  For the numbers to make any sense you probably want to turn
on the
.Va debug.ktr.resynchronize
sysctl variable.
.It Fl x
Print the call chain leading up to the procedure which issued
the KTR.
.It Fl t
Print the timestamp for each entry.
.Xr ktr 4
manual page.
.It Fl N Ar execfile
The kernel image to resolve symbols from.
The default is the value returned via
.Xr getbootfile 3 .
.It Fl M Ar corefile
The core file or memory image to read from.
The default is
.Pa /dev/mem .
.It Fl o Ar outfile
The file to write the output to.
The default is standard output.
