.Nd Undo changes made to files on HAMMER filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adDiuv
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl t Ar transaction-id
.Op Fl t Ar transaction-id

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility acquires an older version of the specified files and can output
them to stdout, generate a file with the previous contents, or generate
a diff to stdout.  A history can also be generated.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Generate a unified diff from the older version to the current version.
.It Fl D
Generate a unified diff from the current version to the older version.
.It Fl i
Generate a single line giving the transaction id and converted timestamp
of the version of the file requested, rather than dumping the contents
of the file.
.It Fl a
Iterate through the file's entire history generating undo files, diffs,
output, etc.  Execute the generation operation for each version.
.It Fl u
Output to a file with name synthesized from the input filename postfixed with ".undo".
If not specified output is either to stdout or, if a single file argument
is given, the file specified by the
.Fl o
option.
.It Fl v
Increase verboseness.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Output to the specified file instead of to stdout.  If iterating through
a file's entire history
.Ar outfile
will be postfixed with an iteration number in the form "outfile.%04d".
If multiple files are specified
.Ar outfile
is used as a template where '%s' is replaced with the last component of
each file path.  When used with multiple files '%%' must be used in the
.Ar outfile
specification to indicate a '%'.  When used with a single file the
.Ar outfile
string is used verbatim.
.It Fl t Ar transaction-id
Specify how far to go back in time, by giving a HAMMER
transaction id (0x16chars).  If not specified
the program will attempt to locate the most recent version of the
file(s) prior to the current version.
This option does not apply if
.Fl a
is specified.
.Pp
A second
.Fl t
specification may be given when the
.Fl d
or
.Fl D
option is used, to provide two end-points for the diff.  The file as-of
the second
.Fl t
is used instead of the current version of the file.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS

.Sh BUGS
HAMMER only synchronizes information to disk every 30 seconds or so and
a quick file create / delete is done entirely in system memory and cannot
be undone.  This can be worked around by running
.Dq Ar hammer synctid Op filesystem .
