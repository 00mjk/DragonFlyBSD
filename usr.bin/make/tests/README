This directory contains regresion tests for make(1).

The tests are invoked via the test.sh script.
	% test.sh [-v] [-m path_to_make_binary] command

	clean	- Remove the results and the other temp files.

	compare	- Check if results of the test match the expected
		  output from stdout, stderr, and the status.

	desc	- print description of test

	diff	- Output the diffs from the tests and the expected
		  stdout, stderr, and the status files.

	run	- Invoke test, compare, and clean in sequence.

	test	- Invoke the test code

	update	- Copy the output of the last test run as the expected
		  output from stdout, stderr, and the status.

Example:
	% sh test.sh -m `pwd`/../obj/make run
