.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will resume the checkpointed program from the specified checkpoint
file.  Programs can be checkpointed using ^E.
.Pp
The checkpt.ko module must be loaded for checkpointing to work.  By default,
only members of the wheel group can checkpoint a program.  The group can be
changed with the sysctl kern.ckptgroup.  The checkpoint file template can be
changed with the sysctl kern.ckptfile. 
.Pp
The checkpointing utility is currently very primitive.  Only programs 
operating on normal files can be properly restored.  Programs which operate
on devices, sockets, or pipes (including piped commands) cannot be restored.
File descriptors 0, 1, and 2, are not saved and the restored program will
inherit the descriptors from
