<td>ATA-RAID ('ar') contains stale code that causes the raid to be marked
damaged, making it unusable and requiring the array to be destroyed and
recreated, and the partition tables to be restored using the same settings
in order to fix (the scan_ffs port helps a lot in that regard).  Do not
use the 1.0A ISO with ata-raid.</td>
