$TITLE(DragonFly - Reporting Bugs)
<P>
The project welcomes all bugs reports and tries to make bug reporting as
painless an affair as possible by providing several ways to report them.
<UL>
    <P>You can email your bug report to: 
	<A HREF="mailto:bugs@dragonflybsd.org">bugs@dragonflybsd.org</A>
    <P>You can post to our private newsgroup: 
	<A HREF="nntp://news.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.bugs">
		nntp://nntp.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.bugs</A>
    <P>And when we have an official bug tracking system in place you will
       be able to submit a bug through that.
</UL>
The email and newsgroup bug reporting methods are meant to be casual affairs.
Being able to post a bug report should give you a good feeling regardless of
whether we are able to act on or respond to it.  Your report will archived
indefinitely so even if we are not able to deal with or respond to it
immediately it will still be registered for possible future action.
<P>
Since this is an open source project, the mileage you get out of reporting a
bug will depend on many factors.  The primary motivator is succinctness and
a high level of detail.  Bug reports containing patches are afforded the
highest level of scrutiny; they are like gold to us.  On our side, an ability
to locate and reproduce the bug greatly enhances our ability to solve the
problem.  If we do not feel we can act on a bug... for example, if the
bug falls outside the project's charter and goals list, we will tell you.
Again, this is not a snub, it is simply a prioritization of work.
<P>
