<h1>Errata Page for DragonFly 1.12.x</h1>

<p>
General note on errata:  We do not roll a release CD every time we bump
the sub-version.  The standard upgrade method is to build from sources.
The 
<A HREF="http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/cgi/web-man?command=build&section=ANY">build</A>
manual page gives you information on how to upgrade your system from
sources.  See the <A HREF="download.cgi">download</A> page for information on tracking changes with
cvsup.
</p>

<h2>1.12.1 Errata</h2>
<h3>System included utilities</h3>
<ul>
    <p>
    A vendor bug in sendmail that was thought to have been fixed still
    had issues.  A new sub-version had to be rolled with the corrected
    sendmail.
</ul>

<h2>1.12.0 Errata</h2>
<h3>CD installation issues</h3>
<ul>
    <p>
    The CD installer considers the CD itself a hard disk and gives you
    the option of partitioning it, installing to it, putting bootblocks
    on it, etc.  This obviously won't work and it is a minor annoyance.
    Simply uncheck the related boxes during the installation process.
