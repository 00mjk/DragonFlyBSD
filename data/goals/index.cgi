$TITLE(DragonFly - Extreme BSD Evolution, The Road to the Future)

<CENTER>What is it?</CENTER>
<P>
DragonFly is going to be a multi-year project.  It will take a lot of groundwork
to even approach the goals we outline here.  By clicking along the left
hand side you can bring up position papers on various nitty-gritty aspects
of kernel and system design which the project hopes to accomplish.
<P>
First and foremost amoung all of our goals is a desire to be able to
implement them in small bite-sized chunks while at the same time maintaining
good stability for the system as a whole.  While the goals are not listed
in any particular order there is a natural order to things which should allow
us to advance in a piecemeal without compromising the stability of the
system as a whole.  It's a laudable goal that will sit foremost in our
minds even though we know it is probably not 100% achievable.   The messaging
system is going to be key to the effort.  If we can get that in-place we
will have an excellent (and debuggable) API on top of which the remainder of
the work can be build.
