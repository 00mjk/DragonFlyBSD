$TITLE(DragonFly - Donations)

<h1>DragonFly - Donations</h1>

<p>
DragonFly is not yet incorporated as a non-profit, meaning no tax benefit is 
available for donating time or goods to the project.  However, developers can 
still use your contributed hardware.  
</p>

<p>
Please email donations at dragonflybsd.org to make a request or when a request is filled, so 
that we may update this page.  Requestors on this page should have at least one 
accepted contribution to DragonFly.
</p>

<p>
Donors, please contact the requestor directly (and CC: 
donations at dragonflybsd.org).  You and the donating/receiving party must 
independently resolve any delivery issues.  The DragonFly BSD Project is 
not responsible for any transactions.  
</p>

<p>
Some tips on sending donated equipment through the mail: Mailing materials out of 
the country usually requires some sort of customs declaration.  State clearly 
on any customs form that the equipment is used, is a gift to an individual and 
not a business, and the value of the equipment (usually less than $50 USD).  
Adding www.dragonflybsd.org as a reference can also help, as this provides 
additional information for a curious customs officer.  It also may help to 
repeat that information in a letter inside the packaging, in case it is opened 
or damaged.
</p>
