<CENTER>Upgrade From FreeBSD to DragonFly In A Few Easy Steps</CENTER><br>
<LI><P>
Starting off with a fresh install of 4.9-RELEASE<br><pre>
gray# uname -a
FreeBSD gray.machdep.com 4.9-RELEASE FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE #0: Mon Oct 27 17:51:09 GMT 2003
root@freebsd-stable.sentex.ca:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  i386
gray# </pre><br>
<LI><P>
The next logical step is to remove any old FreeBSD source or object files
that are still on the system by:<pre>
gray# rm -rf /usr/src
gray# rm -rf /usr/obj
gray# mkdir /usr/obj</pre><br>
<LI><P>
At this point we will need to pull down the DragonFly source tree.<br>
It is expected that you will have the application <b><u>cvsup</b></u> installed 
already<br>
at this time, but if not you can quickly install by:<br><pre>
gray# pkg_add http://machdep.com/drhodus/cvsup-without-gui-16.1h.tgz
Fetching http://machdep.com/drhodus/cvsup-without-gui-16.1h.tgz... Done.
gray#</pre><br>

You will want to type:<br><pre>
gray# rehash
gray#</pre><br>

To refresh your shells path to pickup the newly installed application.<br>
You will want to grab the DragonFly cvsup file now.<br><pre>
gray# fetch http://machdep.com/drhodus/DragonFly-src-supfile
</pre><br>

<LI><P>
You will now want to run cvsup using the config file you just downloaded.<br><pre>
gray# cvsup DragonFly-src-supfile</pre><br>

This will download the source files into /usr/src
<LI><P>
You will now want to compile the userland and the kernel. This is done<br>
with two commands:<br><pre>
gray# cd /usr/src
gray# make buildworld
gray# make buildkernel</pre><br>
<LI><P>
You will now want to install the new userland and kernel. This is also<br>
done with two easy commands:<br><pre>
gray# make installworld
gray# make installkernel</pre><br>
<LI><P>
One last thing, you will want to upgrade the /etc/ directory before rebooting<br>
This last step is done by:<br><pre>
gray# /usr/src/etc
gray# make upgrade_etc</pre><br>
<LI><P>
Now your all done. You'll want to sync the disk and reboot the machine now<br><pre>
gray# sync
gray# reboot</pre><br><br>
