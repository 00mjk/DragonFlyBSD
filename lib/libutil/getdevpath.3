.Sh NAME

.Nd retrieve device path given name or label
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft char *
.Fn getdevpath "const char *devname" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getdevpath
Takes a device name such as "da0", a device identifier such as "V21JYQ0G",
a device path beginning with "/" or ".", or a device label from one of the
.Pa devtab
files, and returns an allocated path which may be used to open the device.
.Pp
Device names prefixed with "/" or "." are assumed to be device paths and an
exact allocated copy is simply returned.  However, flags may modify the
operation.
.Pp
Device names specified with a type prefix, such as "serno:V21JYQ0G" are
assumed to be typed device identifiers and are directly translated to
the appropriate path in
.Pa /dev ,
for example "/dev/serno/V21JYQ0G".
.Pp
Device labels are directly checked against
.Pa /dev
first, using lstat(), and if not found will be searched for in one of the
.Pa devtab
files.
.Pp
.Sh FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width XXX -offset XXX
.It Li GETDEVPATH_RAWDEV
Normally
.Fn getdevpath
returns a high level devfs path which often winds up being a softlink in
devfs.
If this flag is specified and the device path represents a softlink,
.Fn getdevpath
will do a readlink and return the actual raw device path instead.
If the device path cannot be lstat()'d this option will return
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn getdevpath
returns a pointer to a malloc()'d path on success and
.Dv NULL
on failure.
If a failure occurs
.Va errno
will be set appropriately.
Note that a malloc()'d path may be returned even if it does not exist
in the filesystem.  Callers should not assume that the device is accessible
unless they can also open the device.
