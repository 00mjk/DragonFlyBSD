.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/syslink.h
.In sys/syslink_msg.h
.Ft int
.Fn syslink "int cmd" "struct syslink_info *info" "size_t bytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn syslink
system call manages the system link protocol interface to the kernel.
At the moment the only command implemented is SYSLINK_CMD_NEW which
establishes a connected pair of file descriptors suitable for communication
between two user processes.  Other system calls may also indirectly return
a syslink descriptor, for example when mounting a user filesystem.
.Pp
System links are not pipes.  Reads and writes are message based and the
kernel carefully checks the syslink_msg structure for conformance.  Every
message sent requires a reply to be returned.  If the remote end dies, the
kernel automatically replies to any unreplied messages.
.Pp
Syslink commands are very similar to high level device operations.  An
out-of-band DMA buffer (<= 128KB) may be specified along with the syslink
message by placing it in iov[1] in a
.Fn readv
or
.Fn writev
system call on a syslink descriptor.  The syslink message must also have the
appropriate flags set for the kernel to recognize the DMA buffer.  The return
value from
.Fn readv
or
.Fn writev
only accounts for iov[0].  The caller checks message flags to determine if
any DMA occured.
.Pp
DMA buffers must be managed carefully.  Sending a command along with a DMA
buffer does not immediately copy out the buffer.  The originator of the
command may free the VM space related to the buffer but must leave the
storage backing the buffer intact until a reply to that command is
received.  For example, the originator can memory map a file and
supply pointers into the mapping as part of a syslink command, then remap
the space for other purposes without waiting for a syslink command to
be replied.  As long as the contents at the related offsets in the backing
store (the file) are not modified, the operation is legal.  Anonymous
memory can also be used in this manner by munmap()ing it after having
sent the command.  However, it should be noted that mapping memory can be
quite expensive.
.Pp
Since there is no reply to a reply, the target has no way of knowing when
the DMA buffer it supplies in a reply will be drained.  Because
of this, buffers associated with reply messages are always immediately copied
by the kernel allowing the target to throw the buffer away and reuse its
memory after replying.  There are no backing object restrictions for replies.
.Pp
The kernel has the option of mapping the originator's buffer directly into
the target's VM space.  DMA buffers must be page-aligned and it is best to
use mmap() to allocate and manage them.  This feature is not yet implemented.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The value -1 is returned if an error occurs, otherwise 0.
The external variable
.Va errno
indicates the cause of the error.
