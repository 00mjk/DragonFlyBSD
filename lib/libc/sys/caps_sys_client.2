Create an IPC client connected to the service specified by the

.Fn getgid ,
then try 0 and 0.
The
.Fa upcid
argument can either be an upcall or a kqueue identifier.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, this function returns a port identifier.
On failure, -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.

.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP"
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
