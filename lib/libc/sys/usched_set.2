.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/usched.h
.Ft int
.Fn usched_set "pid_t pid" "int cmd" "void *data" "int bytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usched_set
function is used to perform several user scheduler tasks.
These tasks include: setting the user scheduler, assigning an LWP to a
specific CPU, adding a CPU to the available CPUs for an LWP,
and removing a CPU from the list of available CPUs for an LWP.
.Pp
The
.Fa cmd
argument specifies the action for 
.Fn usched_set
to take.
.Dv USCHED_SET_SCHEDULER
sets the user scheduler where
.Fa data
is a
.Vt char *
that contains the name of the user scheduler.
.Dv USCHED_SET_CPU
assigns the LWP to the cpuid pointed to by 
.Fa data .
.Dv USCHED_ADD_CPU
adds the cpuid specified by 
.Fa data
to the list of available CPUs for the LWP.
.Dv USCHED_DEL_CPU
removes the cpuid specified by
.Fa data
from the list of available CPUs for the LWP.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The user scheduler to set is not in the list of available user schedulers.
The
.Fa bytes
argument does is not the correct size
.Vt ( int )
for a cpuid.
The specified cpuid is not set in
.Va smp_active_mask .
.Fa Cmd
contains an unkown value.
.It Bq Er EFBIG
The specified cpuid is not a valid cpuid for the system.
.It Bq Er EPERM
Deleting the specified cpuid leaves the LWP without a CPU to run on.
