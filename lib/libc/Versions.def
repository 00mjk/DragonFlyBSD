# Note: Whenever bumping the DFLY version, always make
#       DFLYprivate_1.0 depend on the new DFLY version.
#       This will keep it at the end of the dependency chain.
#

# This is our first version; it depends on no other.
# This version was first added to DragonFly 3.5 
DFLY36.0 {
};

# This is our private namespace.  Any global interfaces that are
# strictly for use only by other DragonFly applications and libraries
# are listed here.  We use a separate namespace so we can write
# simple ABI-checking tools.
#
# Please do NOT increment the version of this namespace.
