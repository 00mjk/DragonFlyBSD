How does CSU work in DragonFly?
===============================

Every GCC carries its own CSU sources which need to be used.  However, we
also provide a part of the startup files.  Unfortunately, GCC does not
support a search path for startup dirs, so we have to put all of them into
the GCC specific library dir, namely /usr/lib/$GCCVER.

This is realized by providing Makefile glue to gnu/lib/gcc*/csu, which
includes lib/csu/${MACHINE_ARCH}/Makefile.csu.
