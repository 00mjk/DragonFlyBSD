The Documentation Project
-------------------------

This folder (src/documentation) is meant for all developers who dread writing
proper documentation.

In here simple place a .txt file describing your work (new functions, API
changes, etc) on all fronts.  The texts will be put in their respective
'book' later on.  See it as a pass-through interface to the documentation
people on the project.

Everything is interesting, how small you might think it is.
