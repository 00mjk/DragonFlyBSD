      <para>&os; is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Computer

	<indexterm><primary>FreeBSD</primary></indexterm>

	Project.  It carries on the distinguished tradition of BSD
	systems development.  In addition to the fine work provided by
	CSRG, the &os; Project has put in many thousands of hours in
	fine tuning the system for maximum performance and reliability in
	real-life load situations.  As many of the commercial giants
	struggle to field PC operating systems with such features,
	performance and reliability, &os; can offer them
	<emphasis>now</emphasis>!</para>

      <para>The applications to which &os; can be put are truly
        limited only by your own imagination.  From software development
	to factory automation, inventory control to azimuth correction of
	remote satellite antennae; if it can be done with a commercial
	&unix; product then it is more than likely that you can do it with
	&os; too!  &os; also benefits significantly from
	literally thousands of high quality applications developed by
	research centers and universities around the world, often
	available at little to no cost. Commercial applications are also
	available and appearing in greater numbers every day.</para>

      <para>Because the source code for &os; itself is generally
        available, the system can also be customized to an almost unheard
	of degree for special applications or projects, and in ways not
	generally possible with operating systems from most major
	commercial vendors.  Here is just a sampling of some of the

      <para>Matthew Dillon, one of the 
      developers for FreeBSD, was growing increasingly frustrated with 
      the FreeBSD Project's direction for release 5.  The FreeBSD 5 
      release had been delayed multiple times, and had performance 
      problems compared to earlier releases of FreeBSD.</para>
    
      <para>&os; was announced in June of 2003.  The 
      code base was taken from the 4.8 release of FreeBSD, which offered 
      better performance and more complete features.  </para>

      <para>Development has proceeded at a very quick rate since then, with 
      Matt Dillon and a small group of developers fixing longstanding 
      BSD bugs and modernizing the new &os; system.</para>

      <para>&os; is an effort to maintain the traditional BSD format - lean, 
      stable code - along with modern features such as lightweight threads, 
      a workable packaging system, and a revised VFS.  Underpinning all this work is 
      efficient support for multiple processors, something rare among open source 
      systems.  Because &os; is built on an existing very stable code base, 
      it is possible to make these radical changes as part of an incremental 
      process.</para>
