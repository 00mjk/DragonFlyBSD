    <title>X Window System Overview</title>


    <para>The X Window System, or 'X', is a standard for windowing 
      environments.  The most common program that implements this standard is 
      <application>XFree86</application>.  
      (<ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/">http://www.xfree86.org</ulink>)  
      There are other commercial and open source efforts available, but they 
      are not covered in this document.</para>

    <title>Obtaining and Configuring XFree86</title>

    <para>Installation of the port 
    <filename role="package">x11/xfree86-4</filename> will automatically 
    install the various packages needed to have a graphical user interface on 
    your DragonFly computer.</para>

    <para>The command <command>XFree86 -configure</command> will make 
    <application>XFree86</application> probe 
    your hardware and write out a potential configuration file, called 
    <filename>XF86Config</filename>, in your current directory.  Place this 
    file in <filename>/etc/X11/</filename> and 
    it will be used automatically when <application>XFree86</application> 
    starts up.</para>

    <para>This file may require further editing for a successful launch of XFree86; 
    check the XF86Config man pages and 
    <ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/">website</ulink> for details.</para>

  <sect1 id="usingx">
    <title>Using XFree86</title>

    <para>The command <command>startx</command> will start XFree86.  You will see 
    a desktop and several <application>XTerms</application>.  This is the default 
    window manager, <application>twm</application>, managing several terminal windows.</para>  

    <sect2 id="windowmanagers">
    <title>Window Managers</title>

    <para>A window manager is a program designed to handle window decorations and 
    behavior in <application>XFree86</application>.  The basic window manager in 
    <application>XFree86</application>, <application>twm</application>, is sufficient 
    to manage a number of simple windows, but there are many more choices available.</para>

    <para>Most desktops use a program suite that includes a window manager.  
    Some of the more common choices as ports are 
    <filename role="package">x11/kde3</filename>, and 
    <filename role="package">x11/gnome2</filename>.  These are complete application 
    sets and also contain a large quantity of desktop software.  Installing one of 
    these two is recommended if you are relatively new to 
    <application>XFree86</application> or DragonFlyBSD.  Other more basic 
    window managers are available in ports.</para>

    <para>XFree86, when started, will read from a file named <filename>.xinitrc</filename> in 
    your home directory, if it exists.  If you wish to run something other than the 
    default window manager, you run it using <filename>.xinitrc</filename>.  
    <command>exec startkde</command> will start KDE3 if you have installed 
    <filename role="package">x11/kde3</filename>.</para>

     <para>where cursorname is one of the directories in
