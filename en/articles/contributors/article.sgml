    <title>Team Members</title>

    <para>These are the people who have commit privileges and do the
      engineering work on the DragonFlyBSD source tree.  We do not
      partition contributors from committers, but individuals
      with commit privileges have to be extra cautious and need to
      handle administrative issues with regard to contributions made
      to the project and to discuss changes with other team members.</para>

    <para>Entries are sorted in alphabetical order by last name.</para>

    <para>The Documentation and Web Team is responsible for a variety of
      tasks and administrative issues, such as handling new documentation
      submissions, corresponding with authors and merging other related

      design and management issues such as updating the information
      etc, incorporating patches from contributors etc.</para>
