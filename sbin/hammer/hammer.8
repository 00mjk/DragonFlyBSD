.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the
.Nm
utility which provides miscellaneous functions related to managing a
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
For a general introduction to the
.Nm HAMMER
file system, its features, and
examples on how to set up and maintain one, see
.Xr HAMMER 5 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
Get help.
.It Fl 2
Tell the mirror commands to use a 2-way protocol, which allows
automatic negotiation of transaction id ranges.  This option is
automatically enabled by the
.Ar mirror-copy
command.
.It Fl r
Specify recursion for those commands which support it.
.It Fl b Ar bandwidth
Specify a bandwidth limit in bytes per second for mirroring streams.
This option is typically used to prevent batch mirroring operations from
loading down the machine.
The bandwidth may be suffixed with 'k', 'm', or 'g' to specify
values in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes per second.
.It Fl c Ar cyclefile
When pruning and reblocking you can instruction
.Nm
to start at the
object id stored in the specified file.
If the file does not exist
Nm
will start at the beginning.
If
Nm
is told to run for a
specific period of time and is unable to complete the operation it will
write out the current object id so the next run can pick up where it left
off.
If
.Nm
runs to completion it will delete the cyclefile.
.It Fl f Ar blkdev[:blkdev]*
Specify the volumes making up a
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
.\" .It Fl s Ar linkpath
.\" When pruning a filesystem you can instruct
.\" .Nm to create softlinks
.\" to available snapshots.
.It Fl i Ar delay
When maintaining a streaming mirroring this option specifies the
minimum delay after a batch ends before the next batch is allowed
to start.
The default is five seconds.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
When pruning and reblocking you can tell the utility to stop after a
certain period of time.  This option is used along with the cycle file
option to prune or reblock a portion of the file system incrementally.
.It Fl v
Increase verboseness.  May be specified multiple times.
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar synctid Ar filesystem Op quick
Generates a guaranteed, formal 64 bit transaction id representing the
current state of the specified
.Nm HAMMER
file system.  The file system will
be synced to the media.
.Pp
If the
.Ar quick
keyword is specified the file system will be soft-synced, meaning that a
crash might still undo the state of the file system as of the transaction
id returned but any new modifications will occur after the returned
transaction id as expected.
.It Ar bstats Op interval
Output
.Nm HAMMER
B-tree statistics until interrupted.
Pause
.Ar interval
seconds between each display.
The default interval is one second.
.It Ar iostats Op interval
Output
.Nm HAMMER
I/O statistics until interrupted.
Pause
.Ar interval
seconds between each display.
The default interval is one second.
.It Ar history Ar path ...
Show the modification history for
.Nm HAMMER
file's inode and data.
.It Ar show
Dump the B-tree. This command needs the
.Fl f
flag.
.\" .It Ar blockmap
.\" Dump the B-tree, record, large-data, and small-data blockmaps, showing
.\" physical block assignments and free space percentages.
.It Ar namekey Ar filename
Generate a
.Nm HAMMER
64 bit directory hash for the specified file name.
The low 32 bits are used as an iterator for hash collisions and will be
output as 0.
.It Ar namekey32 Ar filename
Generate the top 32 bits of a
.Nm HAMMER
64 bit directory hash for the specified
file name.
.It Ar prune Ar softlink-dir
Prune the file system based on previously created snapshot softlinks.
Pruning is the act of deleting file system history.
The
.Ar prune
command
will delete file system history such that
the file system state is retained for the given snapshots,
and all history after the latest snapshot,
but all other history is deleted.
.Pp
The target directory is expected to contain softlinks pointing to
snapshots of the file systems you wish to retain.  The directory is scanned
non-recursively and the mount points and transaction ids stored in the
softlinks are extracted and sorted.
The file system is then explicitly pruned according to what is found.
Cleaning out portions of the file system is as simple as removing a softlink
and then running the
.Ar prune
command.
.Pp
As a safety measure pruning only occurs if one or more softlinks are found
containing the @@ snapshot id extension.
.Pp
Currently the scanned softlink directory must contain softlinks pointing
to a single
.Nm HAMMER
mount.  The softlinks may specify absolute or relative
paths.  Softlinks must use 20-character (@@0x%016llx) transaction ids,
as might be returned from
.Dq Nm Ar synctid filesystem .
.Pp
Example, lets say your snapshot directory contains the following links:
.Bd -literal
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  29 May 31 17:57 snap1 ->
/usr/obj/@@0x10d2cd05b7270d16

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  29 May 31 17:58 snap2 ->
/usr/obj/@@0x10d2cd13f3fde98f

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  29 May 31 17:59 snap3 ->
/usr/obj/@@0x10d2cd222adee364
.Ed
.Pp
If you were to run the
.Ar prune
command on this directory, then the
.Nm HAMMER
.Pa /usr/obj
mount will be pruned to retain the above three snapshots.
In addition, history for modifications made to the file system older than the oldest
snapshot will be destroyed and history for potentially fine-grained modifications made
to the file system more recently than the most recent snapshot will be
retained.
.Pp
If you then delete the snap2 softlink and rerun the
.Ar prune
command,
history for modifications pertaining to that snapshot would be destroyed.
.It Ar prune-everything Ar filesystem
This command will remove all historical records from the file system.
This directive is not normally used on a production system.
.Pp
Note that pruning a file system may not immediately free-up space,
though typically some space will be freed if a large number of records are
pruned out.  The file system must be reblocked to completely recover all
available space.
.It Ar snapshot Ar snapshot-dir
.It Ar snapshot Ar filesystem snapshot-dir
Takes a snapshot of the file system either explicitly given by
.Ar filesystem
or implicitly derived from the
.Ar snapshot-dir
argument and creates a symlink in the directory provided by
.Ar snapshot-dir
pointing to the snapshot.
If
.Ar snapshot-dir
is not a directory, it is assumed to be a format string
passed to
.Xr strftime 3
with the current time as parameter.
If
.Ar snapshot-dir
refers to an existing directory, a default format string of "snap-%Y%d%m-%H%M"
is assumed and used as name for the newly created symlink.
Assuming that
.Pa /mysnapshots
is on file system
.Pa /
and that
.Pa /obj
is a file system on its own, the following invocations:
.Bd -literal
hammer snapshot /mysnapshots

hammer snapshot /mysnapshots/%Y-%m-%d

hammer snapshot /obj /mysnapshots/obj-%Y-%m-%d
.Ed
.Pp
would create symlinks similar to:
.Bd -literal
/mysnapshots/snap-20080627-1210 -> /@@0x10d2cd05b7270d16

/mysnapshots/2008-06-27 -> /@@0x10d2cd05b7270d16

/mysnapshots/obj-2008-06-27 -> /obj@@0x10d2cd05b7270d16
.Ed
.It Ar reblock Ar filesystem Op Ar fill_percentage
.It Ar reblock-btree Ar filesystem Op Ar fill_percentage
.It Ar reblock-inodes Ar filesystem Op Ar fill_percentage
.It Ar reblock-dirs Ar filesystem Op Ar fill_percentage
.It Ar reblock-data Ar filesystem Op Ar fill_percentage
Attempt to defragment and free space for reuse by reblocking a live
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
Big blocks cannot be reused by
.Nm HAMMER
until they are completely free.
This command also has the effect of reordering all elements, effectively
defragmenting the file system.
.Pp
The default fill percentage is 100% and will cause the file system to be
completely defragmented.  All specified element types will be reallocated
and rewritten.  If you wish to quickly free up space instead try specifying
a smaller fill percentage, such as 90% or 80% (the '%' suffix is not needed).
.Pp
Since this command may rewrite the entire contents of the disk it is
best to do it incrementally from a
.Xr cron 8
job along with the
.Fl c Ar cyclefile
and
.Fl t Ar seconds
options to limit the run time.
The file system would thus be defragmented over long period of time.
.Pp
It is recommended that separate invocations be used for each data type.
B-tree nodes, inodes, and directories are typically the most important
elements needing defragmentation.  Data can be defragmented over a longer
period of time.
.It Ar pfs-status Ar dirpath
Retrieve the mirroring configuration parameters for the specified
.Nm HAMMER
file system or pseudo-filesystem.
.It Ar pfs-master Ar dirpath Op options
Create a pseudo-filesystem (PFS) inside a
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
Up to 65535 such file systems can be created.
Each PFS uses an independent inode numbering space making it suitable
for use as a replication source or target.
.Pp
The
.Ar pfs-master
directive creates a PFS that you can read, write, and use as a mirroring
source.
.It Ar pfs-slave Ar dirpath Op options
Create a pseudo-filesystem (PFS) inside a
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
Up to 65535 such file systems can be created.
Each PFS uses an independent inode numbering space making it suitable
for use as a replication source or target.
.Pp
The
.Ar pfs-slave
directive creates a PFS that you can use as a mirroring target.
You will not be able to access a slave PFS until you have completed the
first mirroring operation with it as the target (its root directory will
not exist until then).
.Pp
Access to the pfs-slave via the special softlink,
as described in the PFS NOTES below, allows
.Nm HAMMER
to
dynamically modify the snapshot transaction id by returning a dynamic result
from
.Xr readlink 2
calls.
.Pp
A PFS can only be truly destroyed with the
.Ar pfs-destroy
directive.
Removing the softlink will not destroy the underlying PFS.
.It Ar pfs-upgrade Ar dirpath
Upgrade a PFS from slave to master operation.  The PFS will be rolled back
to the current end synchronization tid (removing any partial synchronizations),
and will then becomes writable.
.Pp
.Em WARNING!
.Nm HAMMER
currently supports only single masters and using
this command can easily result in file system corruption if you don't
know what you are doing.
.Pp
This directive will refuse to run if any programs have open descriptors
in the PFS, including programs chdir'd into the PFS.
.It Ar pfs-downgrade Ar dirpath
Downgrade a master PFS from master to slave operation.  The PFS becomes
read-only and access will be locked to its
.Ar sync-end-tid .
.Pp
This directive will refuse to run if any programs have open descriptors
in the PFS, including programs chdir'd into the PFS.
.It Ar pfs-destroy Ar dirpath
This permanently destroys a PFS.
.Pp
This directive will refuse to run if any programs have open descriptors
in the PFS, including programs chdir'd into the PFS.
.It Ar pfs-update Ar dirpath Op options
Update the configuration parameters for an existing
.Nm HAMMER
file system
or pseudo-filesystem.  Options that may be specified:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It sync-beg-tid=0x16llx
This is the automatic snapshot access starting transaction id for mirroring slaves.
This parameter is normally updated automatically by the
.Ar mirror-write
directive.
.Pp
It is important to note that accessing a mirroring slave
with a transaction id greater than the last fully synchronized transaction
id can result in an unreliable snapshot since you will be accessing
data that is still undergoing synchronization.
.Pp
Manually modifying this field is dangerous and can result in a broken
mirror.
.It sync-end-tid=0x16llx
This is the current synchronization point for mirroring slaves.
This parameter is normally updated automatically by the
.Ar mirror-write
directive.
.Pp
Manually modifying this field is dangerous and can result in a broken
mirror.
.It shared-uuid=<uuid>
Set the shared UUID for this file system.  All mirrors must have the same
shared UUID.  For safety purposes the mirror-write directives will refuse
to operate on a target with a different shared UUID.
.Pp
Changing the shared UUID on an existing, non-empty mirroring target,
including an empty but not completely pruned target, can lead
to corruption of the mirroring target.
.It unique-uuid=<uuid>
Set the unique UUID for this file system.  This UUID should not be used
anywhere else, even on exact copies of the file system.
.It label=<string>
Set a descriptive label for this file system.
.El
.It Ar mirror-read Ar filesystem Op Ar <begin-tid>
Generate a mirroring stream to stdout.
The stream ends when the transaction id space has been exhausted.
.It Ar mirror-read-stream Ar filesystem Op Ar <begin-tid>
Generate a mirroring stream to stdout.
Upon completion the stream is paused until new data is synced to the
master, then resumed.
Operation continues until the pipe is broken.
.It Ar mirror-write Ar filesystem Op Ar
Take a mirroring stream on stdin and output it to stdout.
.Pp
This command will fail if the
.Ar shared-uuid
configuration field for the two file systems do not match.
.It Ar mirror-dump
A mirror-read can be piped into a mirror-dump to dump an ascii
representation of the mirroring stream.
.It Ar mirror-copy Ar [[user@]host:]filesystem Ar [[user@]host:]filesystem
This is a shortcut which pipes a
.Ar mirror-read
command to a
.Ar mirror-write
command.  If a remote host specification is made the program forks a
.Xr ssh 1
and execs the
.Ar mirror-read
and/or
.Ar mirror-write
on the appropriate host.
The source may be a master or slave PFS, and the target must be a slave PFS.
.Pp
This command also established full duplex communication and turns on
the two-way protocol feature which automatically negotiates transaction id ranges
without having to use a cycle file.
If the operation completes successfully the target PFS's
.Ar sync-end-tid
will
be updated.  Note that you must re-chdir into the target PFS to see the
updated information.  If you do not you will still be in the previous snapshot.
.It Ar mirror-stream Ar [[user@]host:]filesystem Ar [[user@]host:]filesystem
This command works similarly to
.Ar mirror-copy
but does not exit unless the pipe is broken.
This command will resume the mirroring operation whenever the master is
synced.  The command is commonly used with
.Fl i Ar delay
and
.Fl b Ar bandwidth
options to keep the mirroring target in sync with the source on a continuing
basis.
.El
.\".Sh EXAMPLES
.Sh PSEUDO FILESYSTEM (PFS) NOTES
The root of a PFS is not hooked into the primary
.Nm HAMMER
file system as a
directory.
Instead,
.Nm HAMMER
creates a special softlink called "@@PFS%05d" (exactly 10
characters long) in the primary
.Nm HAMMER
file system.
.Nm HAMMER
then modifies the contents of the softlink as read by
.Xr readlink 2 ,
and thus what you see with an
.Xr ls 1
command or if you were to
.Xr cd 1
into the link.
If the PFS is a master the link reflects the current state of the PFS.
If the PFS is a slave the link reflects the last completed snapshot, and the
contents of the link will change when the next snapshot is completed, and
so forth.
.Pp
PFS support is currently very new and experimental.  The
.Nm
utility
employs numerous safeties to reduce user foot-shooting.
The
.Ar mirror-copy
directive requires that the target be configured as a slave and that the
.Ar shared-uuid
field of the mirroring source and target match.
