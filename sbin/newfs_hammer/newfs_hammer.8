.Nd construct a new HAMMER file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl u Ar undosize
.Ar special ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a HAMMER filesystem on device
.Ar special .
If multiple devices are specified a single HAMMER filesystem is created
which spans all of them.
HAMMER filesystems are sector-size agnostic, however the
.Dx
implementation requires the sector size to be no larger than 16K.
HAMMER filesystems start at a relative offset of 0 and may only be created
under out-of-band disk labels (disklabel64 or gpt labels), or in standard
disklabel partitions which do not overlap the label area.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L Ar label
All HAMMER filesystems must be named and names should be unique on a
per-machine basis.
.It Fl b Ar bootsize
Specify a fixed area in which a boot related kernel and data can be stored.
By default a boot area of approximately 4MB will be created.
.It Fl m Ar savesize
Specify a fixed area which HAMMER may use as a memory log.  This area is
currently unused.
.It Fl u Ar undosize
Specify the size of the fixed UNDO FIFO.  By default 0.1% of the root
volume's size is used, with a reasonable minimum and a reasonable cap.
The UNDO FIFO is used to sequence meta-data out to the media for instant
crash recovery.
