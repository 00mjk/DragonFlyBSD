.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_hammer
.Nd construct a new HAMMER file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl c Ar clusize
.Op Fl S
.Op Fl U Ar uuid
.Ar special
.Op special...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a HAMMER filesystem on device
.Ar special .
If multiple devices are specified a single HAMMER filesystem is created
which spans all of them.  HAMMER filesystems are sector-size agnostic,
however the
.DX
implementation requires the sector size to be no larger then 16K.
HAMMER filesystems start at a relative offset of 0 and may only be created
under out-of-band disk labels (disklabel64 or gpt labels), or in standard
disklabel partitions which do not overlap the label area.
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L Ar label
All HAMMER filesystems must be named and names should be unique on a
per-machine basis.
.It Fl U Ar uuid
All HAMMER filesystems are assigned a globally unique UUID.  If no UUID
is specified one will be synthesized.
.It Fl S
Force the HAMMER filesystem to be formatted with a supercluster layer,
allowing it to support volumes greater then 2TB.  This option is automatically
enabled if formatting HAMMER on a large disk.
.It Fl c Ar clusize
HAMMER organizes file objects in clusters and supeclusters.  Clusters
default to the maximum size, which is 64MB.  A smaller size may be chosen
if desired.  This option is not recommended.  HAMMER will use a truncated
cluster as the last cluster and still use all available disk space
regardless of the cluster size.
