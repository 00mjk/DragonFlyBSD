.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_hammer
.Nd mount a HAMMER file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar mount-options
.Op Fl T Ar transaction-id
.Ar special ...
.Ar mount-point
.Nm
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl o Ar mount-options
.Ar mount-point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility mounts a HAMMER filesystem backed by one or more block devices.
.Ar Special
files can be separated by colon,
.Dq \&: ,
instead of blanks, this is usefull in
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar mount-options
Specify mount options, which are a comma delimited set of options (see
.Xr mount 8 ) .
Supported mount options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar ro
Issue a read-only mount.
.It Ar nohistory
Put the entire filesystem in no-history mode.  Change history is not
retained.
Use of this option may increase the overhead of doing mirroring.
This option is generally only used in an emergency.
.It Ar master=<id>
Assign a master id for the entire mount which applies to all PFSs under
the mount.  This is intended to help support multi-master and fail-over
operation.  Multi-master operation is not yet supported.  If you intend
to upgrade slaves to masters and downgrade masters to slaves as part of
a fail-over setup, it's a good idea to assign a different master id
to the HAMMER mounts making up the fail-over group.
.It Ar nomirror
By default a HAMMER mount assigns a master id of 0.  You can force
no-mirror operation by specifying this option.  This option disables
mirror transaction id propagation in the B-Tree and will improve write
performance somewhat but also prevents incremental mirroring from working
at all, and is not recommended.
.El
.It Fl T Ar transaction-id
Mount the filesystem as-of a particular
transaction id.
The mount will automatically be made read-only.
The
.Ar transaction-id
must be specified as a 64 bit hex value prefixed with "0x".
.It Fl u
Update the mount point.  This is typically used to upgrade a mount to
read-write or downgrade it to read-only.
.El
.Sh NOTES
Note that issuing a read-only mount which requires UNDOs to be run will
still run the UNDOs, but will not flush the buffer cache buffers until/if
the mount is updated to read-write.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_hammer -o ro,noatime /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
Mount a HAMMER filesystem made up of two volumes onto
.Pa /mnt .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on error.
