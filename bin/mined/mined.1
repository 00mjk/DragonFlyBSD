.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a simple text editor primarily designed for use when a
system is booted single-user and has no /usr (and thus no access to
vi).

.Sh CAVEATS
This utility is designed as an emergency editor for single-user mode
when /usr is not available.  The terminal type is hardwired to either
an xterm or cons25 (video console).  The editor understands stty 
rows and columns but is otherwise meant to be fairly minimal in scope.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in Minix .  It was brought into PicoBSD for a
time, and some work was done on it, then later brought into DragonFly
where some additional usability work was done on it.
