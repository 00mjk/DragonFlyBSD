			    README FILE FOR CPDUP

    The manual page for cpdup is "cpdup.1".  This file describes various
    porting issues.  

    Most BSDs should just be able to compile cpdup using the Makefile.

Linux:
    This script should suffice when compiling under linux.  For some reason
    that I cannot fathom, linux defaults to using a 32 bit off_t.  It makes
    no sense at all to me why they would want to do this, BSDs went to
    a 64 bit default off_t over 15 years ago.  In anycase, fixing it 
    requires a few -D options.

    #!/bin/csh
    #
    cd cpdup
    rm -f md5.c
    rm -f *.o
    cc -c -D__unused= -D_GNU_SOURCE -D__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 -DNOMD5 *.c
    cc -D__unused= -D_GNU_SOURCE -D__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 -DNOMD5 *.o -o ~/bin/cpdup
