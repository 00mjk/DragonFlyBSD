.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility makes an exact mirror copy of the source in the destination, creating
and deleting files and directories as necessary.  UTimes, hardlinks, 
softlinks, devices, permissions, and flags are mirrored.  By default,
.Nm
asks for confirmation if any file or directory needs to be removed from
the destination and does not copy files which it believes to have already
been synchronized (by observing that the source and destination file's size 
and mtimes match).
.Nm
does not cross mount points in the source but may cross mount points in the
destination.  As a safety measure,
.Nm
refuses to replace a destination directory with a file.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl v[vvv]
Set verboseness.  By default
.Nm
does not report its progress except when asking for confirmation.  A single
.Fl v
will only report modifications made to the destination.
.Fl vv
will report directories as they are being traversed as well as 
modifications made to the destination.
.Fl vvv
will cause all files and directories to be reported whether or not
modifications are made.
.It Fl u
Causes the ouptut generated by
.Fl v[vv]
to be unbuffered.
This can be useful for obtaining prompt progress updates through a pipe.
.It Fl I
will cause cpdup to print a summary at the end with performance counter.
.It Fl f
Forces file updates to occur even if the files appear to be the same.
.It Fl s0
Disable the disallow-file-replaces-directory safety feature.  This
safety feature is enabled by default to prevent user mistakes from blowing
away everything accidently.
.It Fl i0
Do not request confirmation when removing something.
.It Fl q
Quiet operation
.It Fl o
Do not remove any files, just overwrite/add.
.It Fl m
Generate and maintain an MD5 checkfile in each directory on the source
and do an MD5 check on each file of the destination when the destination
appears to be the same as the source.  If the check fails, 
.Nm
the source is recopied to the destination.  When you specify a destination
directory the MD5 checkfile is only updated as needed and may not be updated
even if modifications are made to a source file.  If you do not specify a
destination directory the
.Nm
command forcefully regenerates the MD5 checkfile for every file in the source.
.It Fl M
Works the same as
.Fl m
but allows you to specify the name of the MD5 checkfile.
.It Fl x
Causes
.Nm
to use the exclusion file ".cpignore" in each directory on the source to
determine which files to ignore.  When this option is used, the exclusion
filename itself is automatically excluded from the copy.  If this option is
not used then the filename ".cpignore" is not considered special and will
be copied along with everything else.
.It Fl X
Works the same as
.Fl x
but allows you to specify the name of the exclusion file.  This file is
automatically excluded from the copy.  Only one exclusion file may be
specified.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if no modifications were made, and >0 if modifications
were made to the destination.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was original created to update servers at BEST Internet circa 1997
and was placed under the FreeBSD copyright for inclusion in the ports area
in 1999.  The program was written by Matthew Dillon and Dima Ruban.
