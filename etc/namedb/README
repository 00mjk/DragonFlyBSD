			Running BIND-9's NAMED 

    First, note that if all you want to do is list a set of name servers,
    you can simply edit /etc/resolv.conf.  There is no need to run named.

    An example /etc/resolv.conf file might be:

    ---- cut here ----
    domain your.domain.blah
    search your.domain.blah someother.domain.blah
    nameserver 192.168.5.5		<<<< IP addresses of nameservers
    nameserver 192.168.5.10
    ---- cut here ----

    If you want to run named the 'named' and 'named.conf' manual pages,
    and other manual pages, should be helpful.  

    To get a basic named running you have to follow these steps:

    * Generate an rndc.key file in /etc/namedb so 'rndc' works
    * Generate localhost.rev and localhost-v6.rev
    * Obtain the latest root.zone file or use named.root.
    * Edit named.conf as appropriate for what you are trying to do.
    * Start named with rndc and enable it in /etc/rc.conf

    (1) Generating rndc.key

	cd /etc/namedb; rndc-confgen -a; chown bind rndc.key

	The default named.conf already contains the appropriate include
	line and controls { } directive to allow rndc to access named
	once a key has been generated.  This program should generate
	a 'rndc.key' file.  Since we run named as user 'bind' by default,
	the rndc.key file must be owned by the 'bind' user.

    (2) Running './make-localhost' in /etc/namedb will generate
	"localhost.rev" and "localhost-v6.rev".  The default named.conf
	file references these files.  It is important for your named.conf
	to be a master for localhost lookups to avoid certain types of
	spoofing attacks.

    (3) Obtain the latest root.zone file.  Running "./getroot" in 
	/etc/namedb will download the latest root.zone file.  Edit
	your named.conf to comment out the named.root hint directive and
	uncomment the root.zone master directive.

	Using a root.zone file is more reliable then using a hint file.
	It is a good idea to run the getroot script once a week from a
	cron job to keep your root.zone file up-to-date.

    (4) Edit named.conf.  If you want to run named it must be for a reason,
	so you need to edit named.conf to set up the desired environment.
	named is typically used as a caching forwarding server, or a 
	straight caching server.

    (5) Start named.  named is typically started using the
	/usr/sbin/named.restart script.  This script will pull in 
	rc.conf to figure out the appropriate arguments and then run rndc
	with the appropriate options to [re]start named.

    Always test your running named to make sure it is operating as advertised.
    Run 'rndc status' to double check rndc's access to the named process,
    and use 'dig @localhost some.domain.name' to run a test lookup on a
    domain using your name server to make sure it works properly.
