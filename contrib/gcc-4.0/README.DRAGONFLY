			GCC-4.0.0 AS USED BY DRAGONFLY

    This directory contains a selected set of files from the gnu 
    gcc-4.0.0 distribution.  The entire distribution is 235MB but
    we really only need around 39MB of it.  No files have been moved
    or modified from their extracted position.

    DO NOT CREATE OR EDIT ANY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY HIERARCHY!  THIS
    HIERARCHY REPRESENTS AN EXACT COPY, MINUS UNNEEDED FILES, OF THE GNU
    GCC DISTRIBUTION.  All modifications are made in the 
    DragonFly build wrapper, in /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc40 and
    /usr/src/gnu/lib/gcc40, by creating overrides or performing surgery
    on the distribution.  The only additional files added to this directory
    are README.DRAGONFLY and README.DELETED. 

	MD5 (gcc-4.0.0.tar.bz2) = 55ee7df1b29f719138ec063c57b89db6


    UPGRADE PROCDURE:

	* download a new gcc-4.0.X dist greater then 4.0.0.

	* extract the archive into this directory, overlaying the
	  existing files.

	* A 'cvs update' will show you what has changed ('M') relative 
	  to what we had before.  There will be hundreds of files marked
	  '?' which, if not needed, should be deleted and NOT COMMITTED.
	  If any new files are needed you can cvs add and commit them.

	* Make sure that both buildworld and a crossbuilt buildworld
	  for supported architectures works before committing the upgrade,
	  making adjustments within /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc40.

	  DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO THE GCC DISTRIBUTION IN THIS CONTRIB
	  DIRECTORY, OTHER THEN TO ADD OR DELETE FILES ASSOCIATED WITH THE
	  GNU DISTRIBUTION.

    Do not overlay major rev changes in the contrib directory or
    build infrastructure directory for older major revs!  Create a new
    major rev directory as contrib/gcc-x.x.  The older major revs in
    contrib/gcc-x.x can be physically removed from the CVS repository,
    leaving only this file (README.DRAGONFLY) and README.DELETED in place.
    Older gcc dists can be recovered by manually unpacking older gnu dists
    in /usr/src/contrib, without CVS support.  Do not physically remove
    the DFly build infrastructure for older GCCs from
    /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/.  cvs delete, sure, but no physical removal,
    because then you won't be able to revert your cvs tree past a major
    rev change.

    The file README.DELETED contains a list of deleted files.
