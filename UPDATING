Updating Information for DragonFly users.

This file should warn you of any pitfalls which you might need to work around
when trying to update your DragonFly system.

If you discover any problem, please contact the bugs@lists.dragonflybsd.org
mailing list with the details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Compiling DragonFly
---------------------

Compiling DragonFly requires an ISO C90 or higher compliant compiler.
Compilers which support this are, amongst others: The GNU C Compiler, The
Intel C++ Compiler, and The TenDRA Compiler.

> Include files
---------------

Due to the source tree reorganization header files have moved to different
locations.  The ufs/ufs directory, for example, now can be found at vfs/ufs.
ufs/ffs can be found in vfs/ufs as well.

Best thing to do would be to rm -rf /usr/include and from /usr/src do a 'make
includes'.  This should repopulate your entire tree.

> Linux emulation
-----------------

Right now there is a reported problem with the Linux emulation layer not
working properly.  This should be fixed soon.

> Kerberos IV
-------------

Kerberos IV (eBones) was removed from the tree, please consider moving to
Kerberos 5 (Heimdal).

> Modules
---------

Right now the modules do not build.  We hope to have them working soon again.
