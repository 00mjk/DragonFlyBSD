		    PORTING FREEBSD DRIVERS TO DRAGONFLY

* Copy the driver code to the appropriate DragonFly directory.  For example,
  a disk driver /usr/src/sys/dev/blah in FreeBSD would likely be 
  /usr/src/sys/dev/disk/blah in DragonFly.

* Edit all source files and move the FBSDID declaration into a comment
  (removing the declaration but leave the CVS id in the comment).  Remove
  the #include <sys/cdefs.h> as well.

* Driver local #include's probably use a <dev/blah/blah.h> path.  These
  need to be changed to "blah.h".   '.' is not included in the #include
  path in FreeBSD builds, but it is in DragonFly builds.

* Other #include's may reference things in <dev/...> which in DragonFly
  reside in <bus/...>.  In particular, dev/pccard becomes bus/pccard.
  Note that defines in FreeBSD's pccard_cis.h reside in DragonFly's
  pccardreg.h .

* The following kernel functions have been renamed in DragonFly:

  malloc(), free() etc.	->	kmalloc(), kfree() etc.
  printf() etc.		->	kprintf() etc.
  psignal()		->	ksignal()

* MUTEX conversion - mutexes are generally replaced by spinlocks.  However,
  DragonFly spinlocks are more restrictive than FreeBSD mutexes so a
  direct replacement is not necessarily appropriate in all cases.  A lockmgr
  lock should be used when a direct replacement is not appropriate.
  In particular, DragonFly does not allow recursive exclusive spinlocks
  and does not allow multiple exclusive spinlocks to be held by any given
  thread.

  Instances of <sys/mutex.h> should be replaced with <sys/spinlock.h>.

  When replacing mutexes with spinlocks it is a good idea to rename 
  the structural field (typically 'mtx') to something else (typically 'spin').

  The &Giant mutex is typically converted to get_mplock() and rel_mplock().
  However, there are places where FreeBSD unlocks giant around some code and
  then relocks giant... those should simply be removed.

  FreeBSD has weird callout + mutex functions.  DragonFly does not integrate
  the two.  Instead, the driver in DragonFly must obtain the spinlocks
  in question in the callback routine.

  As a rule of thumb, MTX_DEF mutexes should be replaced with exclusive,
  recursive lockmgr locks.

  So, suppose the original code is using 
	struct mtx my_mtx;
  you'd normally rename it to
	struct lock my_lock;

  and change the initialization from something like
	mtx_init(&my_mtx, "mymtx", "whatever", MTX_DEF);
  to
	lockinit(&my_lock, "mylock", 0, LK_CANRECURSE);

  Destroying it is trivial,
	mtx_destroy(&my_mtx);
  becomes
	lockuninit(&my_lock);

  You use the same function for locking and unlocking a lockmgr lock,
  so exchange
	mtx_lock(&my_mtx);
  with
	lockmgr(&my_lock, LK_EXCLUSIVE);
  and
	mtx_unlock(&my_mtx);
  with
	lockmgr(&my_lock, LK_RELEASE);

  For testing the lock status, one would use
	lockstatus(&my_lock, curthread);
  in place of
	mtx_owned(&my_mtx);

  An
	mtx_trylock(&my_mtx);
  call is replaced with
	lockmgr(&my_lock, LK_EXCLUSIVE|LK_NOWAIT);

  As for mtx_assert() calls, translate them like this:

	mtx_assert(&my_mtx, MA_OWNED) -> KKASSERT(lockstatus(&my_lock, curthread) != 0)
	mtx_assert(&my_mtx, MA_NOTOWNED) -> KKASSERT(lockstatus(&my_lock, curthread) == 0)

  In DragonFly, lockstatus() does not return information about whether there have been
  recursive lock acquisitions, so there is no generic way to emulate the

	mtx_assert(&my_mtx, MA_OWNED|MA_RECURSED);
	mtx_assert(&my_mtx, MA_OWNED|MA_NOTRECURSED);

  calls.
	
* UMA conversion - generally speaking UMA should be converted to a standard
  kmalloc.

  Note however that in FreeBSD M_NOWAIT is often used in cases where, in fact,
  the kmalloc cannot fail without blowing something up or causing a fatal
  (and very unexpected) I/O error.  M_INTWAIT should be used for these cases.

* CDEVSW conversion - see other devices.  Generally speaking a major number
  is needed and a function map needs to be specified more explicitly.

  Most calls passing struct cdev pointers are dev_t's in DragonFly.

  All device vectors in DragonFly pass a dev_<name>_args structure pointer
  instead of explicit arguments.

  Strategy calls - we pass BIO's and a lot of BUF fields are in the BIO
  in FreeBSD, but left in the BUF in DragonFly.  FreeBSD for some reason
  names its struct bio pointers 'bp', its a good idea to rename them to 'bio'
  to avoid confusion and have a struct buf *bp = bio->bio_buf; pointer to
  access the buf.

* TSLEEP conversion.  The DragonFly tsleep does not have 'PRI' priorities.
  0 should be used.

* BUS_* FUNCTIONS

  bus_setup_intr() - replace INTR_TYPE_* flags with 0.  There is an extra
  argument for an interrupt interlock using the sys/serializer.h interface.
  This can either be left NULL or you can convert the spinlock(s) for
  the driver into serializer locks and integrate the interrupt service
  routine with a serializer.
