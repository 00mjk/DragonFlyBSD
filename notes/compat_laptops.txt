			    Compatible laptops

    This file contains a very incomplete list of laptops known to work 
    reasonably well with DragonFly.

Craig Dooley:
    I have an hp pavilion zt3020us (also sold as the hp pavilion nx7000 i
    believe and a compaq x1000).  3+ hours battery life, 15.4" wxga,
    radeon 9200 (not really since the intel chipset doesn't support agp
    8x, and thats the only difference between the 9200 and the 9100 i
    believe).  A little heavier than I'd like at about 6 lbs, but
    everything works except suspend.  Wireless is supported through a
    third party driver, or the ndis wrapper.  Also, it has one firewire
    port than is mini, but it does work to mount my ipod off of. 

Paul Grunwald:
    For what it is worth, my IBM r32 seems to be well supported.  I got this 
    refurb'd with a 3 Year IBM warranty for $800 from off-leasecomputers.com.  
    I have wireless, Xfree86, and sound working,  I have not had time to play 
    with sleep/suspend, firewire, etc. but it all seems to be seen.  Battery 
    life is about 2 hours.  

    In general, I think the IBM laptops are well supported (and well 
    supported in Linux).  TechBargains had a good deal on a t42 a couple of 
    days ago.
    "IBM Thinkpad t42 Centrino $1199 - January 5, 2005
    IBM has the light 4.5lb Thinkpad t42 Centrino Notebook Pentium M 1.6Ghz 
    256MB/40GB, DVD/CDRW, 14.1in screen, 802.11g, Gigabit Ethernet $1199.20 
    shipped free, save $300. $29.99 upgrade to Office 2003 Basic.  "

Matt Dillon:
    I've had good success with my Sony VAIO TR3A, and my older 
    Sony VAIO PCG-F560.  I haven't tried sleep mode on the TR3A and the
    Sony BIOS does not have any modes that use the full width of its
    screen (why Sony would not include such a mode is beyond me), but 
    everything else appears to work pretty well.

    I've had bad luck with the eMachines 6809.  Neither USB nor
    the network work very well.

Bryan Berch:
    I had an eMachines 6805, AMD64, for a week in March 2003.  Everything
    worked fine that I tried in FreeBSD and is on the Freebsd compatiblity
    list.  [DragonFly status on 6805 is not known].

    Compaq R3306US - This is the one that wouldn't boot a normal iso
    and you did the one to get past the keyboard.  It would boot with
    that iso, but the laptop's keyboard would not work after boot.  If a usb
    keyboard was attached and then booted the usb keyboard would work, but 
    could not get the laptops keyboard to work even then.

    Gateway 7422GX (AMD64 3400+) I hope to install this weekend as a dual 
    boot till I am sure it all works and I can learn enough to set-up 
    a network.

    Specs here: https://www.gateway.com/home/products/ret/ret_7422gx.shtml

    Running the live cd.  ifconfig recognizes: vr0 fwe0.  Card reader 
    reads Sans Disks from camara USB cordless mouse works.  Read and 
    write to SanDisk USB cruzer mini.  Has firewire, but not tested.

Justin Sherrill:
    I have a IBM ThinkPad 600E, model number 2645-4AU.  The pcmica slots 
    do not work unless I add this to /boot/device.hints:

    hw.cbb.start_memory="0x20000000"
    hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
    hw.pci.allow_unsupported_io_range="1" 

    I have had trouble getting an Xircom Ethernet card and Linksys 
    Linksys Instant Wireless (version 2.5) card working; the wireless 
    card only worked on the first insertion.  The Xircom card (xe0) is 
    recognized but errors out when activated.  Sound does not work, 
    though there are various tips out there from FreeBSD users on other 
    600E series laptops who did manage to get it working.  The CD drive, 
    xorg, keyboard, etc. all work.

    The card troubles may be due to physical damage; It's used, and 
    I saw the same problems with the card slot under other operating systems.

Jeremy C. Reed:
     I have a GQ (Great Quality) MX-3201 laptop. I believe it
     is also known as the ECS G320 (or Green320). It has a VIA C3
     Nehemiah 1.2 GHz processor. The touchpad mouse (psm0) does not
     work because the "synaptics" support has not been added
     (available from FreeBSD). (Using serial port with serial mouse
     works fine with moused.) The VIA VT6102 Rhine II 10/100BaseTX
     interface works fine as vr0.  Older versions of X do not support
     the VIA video card, but recent versions of X.org do now support it.
     TODO: document sound, USB, modem.

Sascha Wildner:
    For what it's worth, it's running fine here on a Dell Inspiron 9300. The 
    SD card reader doesn't work and messing with the iwi card has had mixed 
    results (but I guess those are software problems).

Johannes Hofmann:
    I am running DragonFly on a Thinkpad T42p for quite a while now.
    The builtin em(4) ethernet card, sound, wifi (ipw(4)), and pcmcia 
    slots work out of the box.
    I added /usr/ports/sysutils/est from FreeBSD to reduce the power usage.
    It's also good to set the DynamicClocks options of the radeon(4) driver
    in xorg.conf, to keep the system cool.
    Suspend to memory does basically work, but some drivers have issues after
    resume, so I prefer booting the system.
    Accellerated 3d graphics and Bluetooth do not yet work, but that's not 
    a high priority for me.

Erik Wikstrom:
    I have a IBM T41, but unfortunately I have not been able to use DFly 
    much lately, however everything seems to be working. I'm running 1.5 
    from late February patched with the ath(4)-patch from Adrian.
