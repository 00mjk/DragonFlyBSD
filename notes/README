Title:	Using The ``doc/notes'' Folder
$DragonFly: doc/notes/Attic/README,v 1.1.1.1 2003/08/26 02:52:15 hmp Exp $
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder (doc/notes) is meant for all developers who dread writing
proper documentation.

In here simple place a .txt file describing your work (new functions, API
changes, etc) on all fronts.  The texts will be put in their respective
'book' later on.  See it as a pass-through interface to the documentation
people on the project.

Please use the (above) following format for describing the meta information
of your .txt file, the <tab> stands for a Tab character; the full meta block
that should be in the file is within the %%%'s (but don't put the %%% in your
.txt file):

%%%
Author:<tab><your-name>
Title:<tab><title-of-your-document>
<CVS-Keyword-for-DragonFly-like-above>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%%%%

Everything is interesting, no matter how small.
