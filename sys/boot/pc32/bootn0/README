		    BOOTN0 - DragonFly rewrite of the Boot0 code

    This code is not yet hooked into the system but will eventually, once
    tested, replace the existing boot0 code.

    This is part of a personal project of mine to relocate *ALL* the boot
    elements to high memory (in the 64KB-640KB range) and to make it possible
    to adjust the relocation addresses without having to go through loops.

    All existing FreeBSD boot code works almost exclusively in the first
    64KB of ram, and through experimentation I have come to the conclusion
    that this is no longer a BIOS-friendly way of doing things.
