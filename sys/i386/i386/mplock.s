 *				DragonFly MPLOCK operation
 *
 * Each thread has an MP lock count, td_mpcount, and there is a shared
 * global called mp_lock.  mp_lock is the physical MP lock and contains either
 * -1 or the cpuid of the cpu owning the lock.  The count is *NOT* integrated
 * into mp_lock but instead resides in each thread td_mpcount.
 *
 * When obtaining or releasing the MP lock the td_mpcount is PREDISPOSED
 * to the desired count *PRIOR* to operating on the mp_lock itself.  MP
 * lock operations can occur outside a critical section with interrupts
 * enabled with the provisio (which the routines below handle) that an
 * interrupt may come along and preempt us, racing our cmpxchgl instruction
 * to perform the operation we have requested by pre-dispoing td_mpcount.
 *
 * Additionally, the LWKT threading system manages the MP lock and
 * lwkt_switch(), in particular, may be called after pre-disposing td_mpcount
 * to handle 'blocking' on the MP lock.
 *
