		ACPI 20061109 AS USED BY DRAGONFLY

    This directory contains a selected set of files from the Intel
    acpica-unix-20061109 distribution.  No files have been moved
    or modified from their extracted position.

    DO NOT CREATE OR EDIT ANY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY HIERARCHY!  THIS
    HIERARCHY REPRESENTS AN EXACT COPY, MINUS UNNEEDED FILES, OF THE INTEL
    ACPICA-UNIX-20061109 DISTRIBUTION.  All modifications are made in the 
    DragonFly build wrapper, primarily in /usr/src/sys/dev/acpica5 and 
    /usr/src/usr.sbin/acpi, by creating overrides or performing surgery
    on the distribution.  The only additional file added to this directory
    is README.DRAGONFLY.  The base source was fetched from:

	http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads/acpica-unix-20061109.tar.gz
	MD5 (acpica-unix-20061109.tar.gz) = 0ca508dd9bec10fb3b53c72aea6bb6a1

    UPGRADE PROCEDURE:

	* download a new acpica-unix distribution and extract the archive
	  under /sys/contrib/dev.  copy README.* files over from the current
	  version, and adjust file names and MD5 sum in README.DRAGONFLY
	  to match with the new version.

	* adjust build wrappers to use new distribution.  /sys/conf/acpi.mk
	  controls the name of the directory containing the acpica-unix
	  distribution.  build a system and make sure the new ACPICA5 module
	  and ACPI tools work properly.  if you had to remove or re-add
	  files in the distribution directory, change README.DELETED
	  accordingly.

	* cvs import the new distribution directory.

	* commit the changes in the build wrapper directories.

	* cvs remove the old distribution directory after a while.

	  DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO THE BINUTILS DISTRIBUTION IN THIS CONTRIB
	  DIRECTORY, OTHER THEN TO README.DRAGONFLY!
