		ACPI 20050309 AS USED BY DRAGONFLY

    This directory contains a selected set of files from the Intel
    acpica-unix-20050309 distribution.  No files have been moved
    or modified from their extracted position.

    DO NOT CREATE OR EDIT ANY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY HIERARCHY!  THIS
    HIERARCHY REPRESENTS AN EXACT COPY, MINUS UNNEEDED FILES, OF THE INTEL
    ACPICA-UNIX-20050211 DISTRIBUTION.  All modifications are made in the 
    DragonFly build wrapper, primarily in /usr/src/sys/dev/acpica5 and 
    /usr/src/sys/i386/acpica5, by creating overrides or performing surgery
    on the distribution.  The only additional file added to this directory
    is README.DRAGONFLY.  The base source was fetched from:

	http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads/acpica-unix-20050309.tar.gz
	MD5 (acpica-unix-20050309.tar.gz) = 862cdc50e58eeda3f8bc4050bffd90a4

    UPGRADE PROCDURE:

	* download a new acpica-unix distribution

	* extract the archive into this directory, overlaying the
	  existing files.

	* cvs add any new files, cvs delete any deleted files relative
	  to the new dist, build a system and make sure the new ACPICA5
	  module works properly, then commit.

	  DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO THE BINUTILS DISTRIBUTION IN THIS CONTRIB
	  DIRECTORY, OTHER THEN TO README.DRAGONFLY!
