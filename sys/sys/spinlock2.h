/*
 * Obtain a shared spinlock and return.  This is a critical code path.

 * The vast majority of the overhead is in the cpu_mfence() (5ns vs 1ns for
 * the entire rest of the procedure).  Unfortunately we have to ensure that
 * spinlock pointer is written out before we check the cpumask to interlock
 * against an exclusive spinlock that clears the cpumask and then checks
 * the spinlock pointer.
 *
 * But what is EXTREMELY important here is that we do not have to perform
 * a locked bus cycle on the spinlock itself if the shared bit for our cpu
 * is already found to be set.  We only need the mfence, and the mfence is
 * local to the cpu and never conflicts with other cpu's.
 *
 * This means that multiple parallel shared acessors (e.g. filedescriptor
 * table lookups, namecache lookups) run at full speed and incur NO cache
 * contention at all.  It is the difference between 10ns and 40-100ns.
