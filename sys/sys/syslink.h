 * SYSIDs are persistently assigned identifiers representing specific devices

 * assigned to a filesystem or ANVIL partition can be stored in that
 * filesystem's superblock and allows the filesystem to migrate or
 * be multi-homed (have multiple physical SYSIDs representing the same
 * logical entity).
 *
 * Physical SYSIDs can be ever-changing, and any given logical SYSID could
 * in fact have multiple physical SYSIDs associated with it.  The mesh is
 * self-healing and the combination of the logical and physical sysid
 * basically validates the message at the target and determines whether
 * the physical SYSID must be recalculated (looked up again) or not.

 * A syslink structure represents an end-point for communications.  System

 * usually embed a syslink structure.  There is typically one master
 * structure (sl_remote_id == 0) and any number of slave structures at
 * remote locations (sl_remote_id on slaves point to master).
 *
 * A ref counter is integrated into the structure and used by SYSLINK to
 * keep track of sysid references sent to remote targets.  This counter
 * may also be used by the governing structure (e.g. vnode) so long as
 * the SYSLINK API is used to manipulate it.
 *
 * An operations vector implements the ABI for the numerous functions
 * associated with the system structure.  E.G. VOPs for vnodes.  The
 * ops structure also references the transport and protocol layers.  Using
 * vnodes as an example, the ops structure would be replicated from a
 * template on a per-mount basis.
