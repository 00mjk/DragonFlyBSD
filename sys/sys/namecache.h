/*
 * The namecache structure is used to manage the filesystem namespace.  Most
 * vnodes cached by the system will reference one or more associated namecache
 * structures.
 *
 * The namecache is disjoint, there may not always be a path to the system
 * root through nc_parent links.  If a namecache entry has no parent, that
 * entry will not be hashed and can only be 'found' via '.' or '..'.
 *
 * Because the namecache structure maintains the path through mount points,
 * null, and union mounts, and other VFS overlays, several namecache
 * structures may pass through the same vnode.  Also note that namespaces
 * relating to non-existant (i.e. not-yet-created) files/directories may be
 * locked.  Lock coherency is achieved by requiring that the particular
 * namecache record whos parent represents the physical directory in which
 * the namespace operation is to occur be the one that is locked.  In 
 * overlay cases, the (union, nullfs) VFS, or in namei when crossing a mount
 * point, may have to obtain multiple namespace record locks to avoid
 * confusion, but only the one representing the physical directory is passed
 * into lower layer VOP calls.
 *
 * Many new API VOP operations do not pass vnodes.  In these cases the
 * operations vector is typically obtained via nc_mount->mnt_vn_use_ops.
