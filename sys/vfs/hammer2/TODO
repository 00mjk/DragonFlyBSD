* The freemap allocator needs to getblk/clrbuf/bdwrite any partial
  block allocations (less than 64KB) that allocate out of a new 64K
  block, to avoid causing a read-before-write I/O.

* Check flush race upward recursion setting SUBMODIFIED vs downward
  recursion checking SUBMODIFIED then locking (must clear before the
  recursion and might need additional synchronization)

* When a directory entry is created and also if an indirect block is
  created and entries moved into it, the directory seek position can
  potentially become incorrect during a scan.

* When a directory entry is deleted a directory seek position depending
  on that key can cause readdir to skip entries.
