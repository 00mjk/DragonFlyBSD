/*
 * If the contents of the userland-supplied pointer matches the specified
 * value enter an interruptable sleep for up to <timeout> microseconds.
 * If the contents does not match then return immediately.
 *
 * The specified timeout may not exceed 1 second.
 *
 * Returns 0 if we slept and were woken up, -1 and ETIMEDOUT if we slept
 * and timed out, and EBUSY if the contents of the pointer did not match
 * the specified value.  A timeout of 0 indicates an unlimited sleep.
 * EINTR is returned if the call was interrupted by a signal.
 *
 * This function interlocks against call to umtx_wakeup.  It does NOT interlock
 * against changes in *ptr.  However, it does not have to.  The standard use
 * of *ptr is to differentiate between an uncontested and a contested mutex
 * and call umtx_wakeup when releasing a contested mutex.  Therefore we can
 * safely race against changes in *ptr as long as we are properly interlocked
 * against the umtx_wakeup() call.
 *
 * The VM page associated with the mutex is held to prevent reuse in order
 * to guarentee that the physical address remains consistent.
