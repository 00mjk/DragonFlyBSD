 * Note: Windows uses the _stdcall calling convention. This means
 * that the callback functions provided in the function table must
 * be declared using __attribute__((__stdcall__)), otherwise the
 * Windows code will likely screw up the %esp register and cause
 * us to jump to an invalid address when it returns.   With the
 * stdcall calling convention the target procedure is responsible for
 * popping the call arguments.
 *
 * Note: Windows often passes arguments in registers.  In windows
 * the order is: %ecx, %edx.  The regparm(3) attribute in GNU C will
 * pass arguments in the order: %eax, %edx, %ecx, with any remaining
 * arguments passed on the stack.
