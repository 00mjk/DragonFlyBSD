Peasant: "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition."
Cardinal Ximinez: "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief weapon is
surprise...surprise and fear...fear and surprise.... Our two weapons are fear
and surprise...and ruthless efficiency.... Our *three* weapons are fear,
surprise, and ruthless efficiency...and an almost fanatical devotion to the
Pope.... Our *four*...no... *Amongst* our weapons.... Amongst our
weaponry...are such elements as fear, surprise.... I'll come in again."
