.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides an interface to manipulate the in-kernel
.Xr devfs 5
ruleset.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Load the ruleset specified by
.Fl f
and apply it.
It will not overwrite currently applied rules,
but just append the new ones.
.It Fl c
Clear the current ruleset.
This does not reset the device nodes, but only clear out all stored rules
so that they are not applied to new nodes.
It is therefore recommended to use this command in conjunction with
.Fl r .
.It Fl d
Reads ruleset specified by
.Fl f
and then dumps its contents to stdout.
The rules will not be applied.
This option cannot be used in conjuction with any other option.
It is useful for checking the correct syntax and order of the specified ruleset
and will show the final interpretation as it would be applied.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specifies the file containing the ruleset to be loaded.
See
.Xr devfs.conf 5
for more information on rule syntax.
This option is a requirement for
.Fl a
and
.Fl d .
.It Fl h
Shows a usage message with a short description of
.Nm Ap s
options.
.It Fl m Ar mount_point
Specifies the mount point to which the loaded rules shall apply.
If this option is not specified, the rules will apply to all
.Xr devfs 5
mountpoints.
The
.Ar mount_point
argument does not accept wildcards and must be an absolute path.
.It Fl r
Reset all
.Xr devfs 5
nodes to their original status.
This does not clear the current ruleset and it is hence recommended
to use this command together with
.Fl c .
