$DragonFly: src/README.amd64,v 1.1 2007/09/23 04:44:41 yanyh Exp $

To build AMD64 port: 

export TARGET_ARCH=amd64
export TARGET_PLATFORM=pc64

make buildworld
make -k buildkernel KERNCONF=AMD64_GENERIC 

you will see errors in the kernel build; to hack, redirect the buildkernel to 
a file and check it out! 

The most recent work is on http://repo.or.cz/w/dragonfly/port-amd64.git
