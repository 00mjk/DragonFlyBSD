.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
functions are typically invoked by drivers in response to requests
for information or to change settings from the userland.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_cfgget
and
.Fn ieee80211_cfgset
functions implement a legacy interface for getting and setting 802.11
interface attributes respectively.
It is used by the
.Xr wicontrol 8
utility but should not be used by any new drivers.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_ioctl
function provides a default implementation of the
.Dv SIOCS80211
and
.Dv SIOCG80211
ifioctls commands for 802.11 drivers.
The call signature is identical to that of the
.Va if_ioctl
member found in
.Vt struct ifnet ,
however, many drivers store attributes such as
.Dv IEEE80211_IOC_STATIONNAME
in the driver's private soft state structure, so driver writers may prefer
to use this as the catch-all in a switch statement to avoid code duplication.
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function
.Fn ieee80211_ioctl
returns 0 or
.Er ENETRESET ,
if successful.
Otherwise, a non-zero value other than
.Er ENETRESET
is returned.
If
.Er ENETRESET
is returned and the interface is up and running,
a driver will typically reinitialize the hardware by calling
.Va if_init .
