.Sh NAME
.Nm BUS_SETUP_INTR
.Nd create and attach to an interrupt handler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft int
.Fn BUS_SETUP_INTR "device_t dev" "device_t child" "struct resource *irq" "int flags" "driver_intr_t *intr" "void *arg" "void **cookiep" "lwkt_serialize_t serializer"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The method
.Nm
will create and attach an interrupt handler to an interrupt
previously allocated by the resource manager's
.Xr BUS_ALLOC_RESOURCE 9
method.
The handler
.Fa intr
will be called with the value
.Fa arg
as its only argument.
.Pp
Interrupt flags are typically either
.Li 0
or
.Dv INTR_MPSAFE .
If
.Dv INTR_MPSAFE
is specified the kernel is free to call the interrupt handler without
holding the MP lock.
.Dv INTR_FAST
is also sometimes specified and allows the
interrupt handler to be directly called from the context of the thread
being interrupted, but is not recommended for most drivers.
Other interrupt flags exist for special purposes.
.Pp
If 
.Fa serializer
is non-NULL the interrupt handler will be called with the serializer held.
The serializer replaces the obsolete SPL calls that are no longer relevant on
SMP systems.
Driver code can obtain the same serializer to interlock against
the driver interrupt.
The serializer also has enablement and disablement
features which mainline driver code can use to avoid races between interrupt
disablement and delayed interrupts executing from the device's interrupt
thread.
.Pp
The interrupt handler will be detached by
.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR .
The cookie will be stored in the pointer
.Fa *cookiep
and needs to be passed to
.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR
in order to tear down the correct interrupt handler.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Zero is returned on success,
otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
