.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm serializer
API provides a fast locked-bus-cycle-based serialization facility
that will serialize across blocking conditions.
It is very similar to a lock but much faster for the common case.
.Pp
This API was initially designed to be a replacement for SPL calls, but
may be used whenever a low level exclusive lock (serialization) and/or
interrupt/device interaction is required.
Unlike tokens this serialization is not safe from deadlocks nor is it
recursive, and care must be taken when using it.
Note that
.Xr tsleep 9
will not release a serializer that is being held.
.Pp
There are two primary facilities \(em the serializer facility itself and
an integrated non-stackable interrupt handler disablement facility
used by drivers.
.Pp
.Fn lwkt_serialize_init ,
.Fn lwkt_serialize_enter
and
.Fn lwkt_serialize_exit
respectively initialize, hold and release the serializer
.Fa s .
.Fn lwkt_serialize_try
is a non-blocking version of
.Fn lwkt_serialize_enter .
.Pp
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_disable ,
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_enable
and
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_call
respectively disable, enable and call an interrupt handler
.Fa func
for the serializer
.Fa s .
The arguments
.Fa arg
and
.Fa frame
will be passed to the handler.
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_try
is a non-blocking version of
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_call .
.Pp
The
.Fn ASSERT_SERIALIZED
macro asserts that the serializer
.Fa s
is being held.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn lwkt_serialize_try
and
.Fn lwkt_serialize_handler_try
functions return 0 on success and 1 on failure.
