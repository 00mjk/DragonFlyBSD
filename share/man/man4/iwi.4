.Sh NAME
.Nm iwi
.Nd Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device iwi"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG and 2915ABG MiniPCI
network adapters.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (aka infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point.
.Pp
In addition IBSS operation (aka adhoc mode) is also supported.
This mode requires special ibss firmware.
.Pp
For more (general) information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh FILES
The firmware for the adapter is not shipped with
.Dx
and must be obtained separately.
An archive with firmware files that are known to work can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php?fid=7
.Ed
.Pp
The firmware files have to reside in
.Pa /etc/firmware/iwi/2200/3.0
and will be loaded when the interface is brought up.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Refer to the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section of
.Xr wlan 4 .
.Sh WORTH NOTING
It's worth noting that in BSS mode if you haven't specified an
ssid, the driver will auto-assign an ssid, joining the best
network available.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwi%d: firmware reset"
The driver has reset the firmware. This shouldn't but may occasionally happen.
.It "iwi%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware. This should not happen.
