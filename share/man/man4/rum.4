.Sh NAME
.Nm rum
.Nd "Ralink Technology RT2501USB/RT2601USB IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device rum"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_onoe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_rum_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless adapters based on the Ralink RT2501USB
and RT2601USB chipsets.
.Pp
The RT2501USB chipset is the second generation of 802.11a/b/g adapters
from Ralink.
It consists of two integrated chips,
an RT2571W MAC/BBP and an RT2528 or RT5226 radio transceiver.
.Pp
The RT2601USB chipset consists of two integrated chips,
an RT2671 MAC/BBP and an RT2527 or RT5225 radio transceiver.
This chipset uses the MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology with
multiple antennas to extend the operating range of the adapter and to achieve
higher throughput.
MIMO is the basis of the forthcoming IEEE 802.11n standard.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rum%d: could not load 8051 microcode"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051
microcontroller unit.
.It "rum%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports automatic adaptation of the transmit speed in IBSS
and HostAP operating modes,
but it does not work well if there are more than one peer node.
