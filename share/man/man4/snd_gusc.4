.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_gusc
.Nd Gravis UltraSound ISA bridge device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pcm"
.Cd "device snd_gusc"
.Ed
.Pp
Non-PnP cards require a setting in the kernel config file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Cd "device pcm0 at isa? port? irq 5 drq 1 flags 0x15"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver
.Xr sound 4
to attach to Gravis UltraSound sound cards.
.Pp
The value of flags specifies the secondary DMA channel.
If the secondary
DMA channel is C, set the flags to (C | 0x10).
For a sound card without the
secondary DMA channel, the flags should be set to zero.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following sound cards:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Gravis UltraSound MAX
.It
Gravis UltraSound PnP
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
