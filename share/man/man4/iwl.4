.Sh NAME
.Nm iwl
.Nd Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2100 IEEE 802.11 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwl"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_iwl_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2100 MiniPCI network
adapter.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (aka infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh FILES
The firmware for the adapter is not shipped with
.Dx
and must be obtained separately.
An archive with firmware files that are known to work can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/firmware.php?fid=4
.Ed
.Pp
The firmware files have to reside in
.Pa /etc/firmware/iwl/2100/1.3
and will be loaded when the interface is brought up.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwl0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwl0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64 bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwl0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128 bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwl0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Pp
Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwl0 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
        mediaopt adhoc
.Ed
.Pp
To debug a network setup, you may wish to enable interface debugging:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwl0 down debug up
.Ed
.Pp
To disable debugging, you may simply use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwl0 down -debug up
.Ed
