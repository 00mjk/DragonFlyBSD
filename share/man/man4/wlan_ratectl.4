.Sh NAME
.Nm wlan_ratectl_amrr ,
.Nm wlan_ratectl_onoe ,
.Nm wlan_ratectl_sample
.Nd rate adaptation support for 802.11 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_amrr"
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_onoe"
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_sample"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Dx
supports several TX rate control algorithms for use with 802.11 devices via the
.Nm wlan_ratectl
modules:
.Bl -tag -width ".Sy sample" -offset indent
.It Sy amrr
Adaptive Multi Rate Retry
.It Sy onoe
Atsushi Onoe's algorithm
.It Sy sample
John C. Bicket's SampleRate algorithm
.El
.Pp
The following devices support TX rate control:
.Xr acx 4 ,
.Xr ral 4 ,
.Xr rtw 4 ,
.Xr rum 4
and
.Xr ural 4 .
See the individual drivers' manual pages for more information on which
algorithms are supported.
.Pp
To select a TX rate control algorithm, use the
.Cm ratectl
parameter of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
