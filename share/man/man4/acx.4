.Sh NAME
.Nm acx
.Nd Texas Instruments ACX100/TNETW1130(ACX111) IEEE 802.11 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in
your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acx"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_onoe"
.Cd "device wlan_ratectl_amrr"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Pa /boot/loader.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_acx_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Texas Instruments ACX100 or
TNETW1130 (aka ACX111) based PCI and Cardbus network adapters.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point. In addition, IBSS
operation (adhoc mode) is also supported.
For more
information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Ss MIB Variables
A number of per-interface variables are implemented in the
.Va hw.acx Ns Em X
branch of the
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va msdu_lifetime"
.It Va msdu_lifetime
MSDU life time.

.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are known to work with the
.Nm
driver:

.Sh FILES
The firmware for the adapter is not shipped with
.Dx
and must be obtained seperately.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Dx 1.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Sepherosa Ziehau .
The manual page was written by
.An Sascha Wildner .
Both are based on the
.Pa http://wlan.kewl.org
project team's original code.
.Pp
The hardware specification was reverse engineered by the good folks at
.Pa http://acx100.sourceforge.net .
Without them this driver would not have been possible.
