.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is the deprecated
.Fx 4.8
ATA driver.
.Dx Ap s
default ATA driver is
.Xr nata 4
which was ported from newer
.Fx
code.
.Pp
This driver provides access to disk drives, ATAPI CD-ROM and DVD drives,
ZIP drives and tape streamers connected to controllers
according to the ATA and ATAPI standards.
These devices are also commonly known as IDE or EIDE devices.
.Pp
The currently supported ATA controllers with their maximum speed include:

.El
.Pp
All unknown chipsets are supported at the maximum speed of 16 MB/sec.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also allows for changes to the transfer mode of the devices
at a later time when the system is up and running, see
.Xr atacontrol 8 .
.Pp
The driver attempts to set the maximum performance transfer mode on your disk
drives by selecting the highest possible DMA mode. However the
.Nm
driver sometimes issue the message
"DMA limited to UDMA33, non-ATA66 cable or device",
if the cable is ATA66 (or above) compliant, it is because the other device
on this channel states it can only accept upto UDMA2/ATA33 signals.
ATAPI devices are left in PIO mode because DMA problems are common despite the
device specifications.
You can always try to set DMA mode on an ATAPI device using
.Xr atacontrol 8 ,
but be aware that your hardware might
.Em not
support it and can
.Em hang
the system.

.Sh NOTES
Static numbering
(enabled with the
.Dv ATA_STATIC_ID
kernel option)
reserves a number for each possibly connected disk,
even when not present.
This may result in odd situations where,
for example,
ad0 and ad2 exist in the absence of ad1.
The advantage is that the addition of the formerly absent drive
does not cause the numbers of the other drives to change.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support MFM/RLL/ESDI (ST-506) style disks.
.Pp
Remember that in order to use UDMA4 (and above) mode you
.Em have
to use a special 80 conductor cable,
and the driver tries to determine if you have such a cable
attached before setting UDMA4 mode.
.Pp
The use of UDMA4(66MHz) and higher together with non-UDMA4 devices on
the same ATA channel is not recommended,
unless they are run at the non-UDMA4 device's lower speed.
The driver has been designed to handle that kind of setup but lots of
older devices do not like this.
