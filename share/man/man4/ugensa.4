.Sh NAME
.Nm ugensa
.Nd Generic USB serial device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ugensa"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ugensa_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is the minimal USB serial driver written to support virtual serial ports in
devices where hardware specific settings (baudrate, flow control etc) don't
make sense or just don't apply.
.Pp
The virtual serial ports are accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes them behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver was originally written to support Qualcomm MSM chipset found in EVDO
and UMTS capable modems, but there is nothing MSM chipset specific in it.
Many devices supported by the driver aren't typical USB devices, but CardBus,
ExpressCard or PCI Express Mini Cards that incorporate a USB controller
with the actual devices attached to it.
.Pp
Communication devices supported by the
.Nm
driver typically have more than one virtual serial port, but only one of
them (usually the first one) can be used with
.Xr ppp 8
or
.Xr pppd 8 .
At least one of additional ports can usually be used for device/network
monitoring and other communication tasks (like SMS for example).
Protocols and methods used to access these features are out of scope of this
driver.
.Pp
The following devices should work with the
.Nm
driver:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0
as
.Nm umsm .
It was imported into
.Dx 1.11
with its present name and extended to support multiple virtual serial ports
per device.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jonathan Gray
.Aq jsg@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
For Verizon Wireless (and possibly other services), cards require a one-time
activation before they will work.
