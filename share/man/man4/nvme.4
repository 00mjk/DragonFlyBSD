.Sh NAME
.Nm nvme
.Nd NVM Express Controller for PCIe-based SSDs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device nvme"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nvme_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCIe storage controllers conforming to the
NVM Express Controller Interface specification.
NVMe controllers have a direct PCIe host interface to the controller
which in turn has a direct connection to the underlying non-volatile
(typically flash) storage, yielding a huge reduction in latency and
increase in performance over
.Xr ahci 4 .
.Pp
In addition, NVMe controllers are capable of supporting up to 65535
independent submission and completion queues each able to support upwards
of 16384 queue entries.  Each queue may be assigned its own interrupt
vector out of the controller's pool (up to 2048).
.Pp
Actual controllers typically implement lower limits.  While most controllers
allow a maximal number of queue entries, the total number of queues is often
limited to far less than 65535.  8-32 queues are commonly supported.
Similarly, while up to 2048 MSI-X vectors can be supported by the spec,
actual controllers typically support fewer vectors.  Still, having several
MSI-X vectors allows interrupts to be distributed to multiple CPUs,
reducing bottlenecks and improving performance.  The multiple queues can
be divvied up across available cpu cores by the driver, as well as split-up
based on the type of I/O operation being performed (such as giving read
and write I/O commands their own queues).  This also significantly
reduces bottlenecks and improves performance, particularly in mixed
read-write environments.
.Sh FORM FACTOR
NVMe boards usually come in one of two flavors, either a tiny form-factor
with a M.2 or NGFF connector, supplying 2 or 4 PCIe lanes, or in a larger
form that slips into a normal PCIe slot.  The larger form typically
implements 2, 4, or 8 lanes.  Also note that adapter cards that fit
into normal PCIe slots and can mount the smaller M.2/NGFF NVME cards can
be cheaply purchased.
.Sh PERFORMANCE
Typical performance for a 2-lane (x2) board is in the 700MB/s to 1.5 GByte/s
range.  4-lane (x4) boards typically range from 1.0 GBytes/s to 2.5 GBytes/s.
Full-blown PCIe cards run the whole gamut, 2.5 GBytes/sec is fairly typical
but performance can exceed 5 GBytes/sec in a high-end card.
.Pp
Multi-threaded random-read performance can exceed 300,000 IOPS on an x4 board.
Single-threaded performance is usually in the 40,000 to 100,000 IOPS range.
Sequential submission/completion latencies are typically below 35uS while
random submission/completion latencies are typically below 110uS.
Performance (uncached) through a filesystem will be bottlenecked by additional
factors, particularly if testing is only being done on a single file.
.Pp
The biggest differentiation between boards is usually write performance.
Small boards with only a few flash chips have relatively low write
performance, usually in the 150MByte/sec range.  Higher-end boards will have
significantly better write performance, potentially exceeding 1.0 GByte/sec.
.Pp
For reference, the SATA-III physical interface is limited to 600 MBytes/sec
and the extra phy layer results in higher latencies, and AHCI controllers are
limited to a single 32-entry queue.
.Sh FEATURES
The
.Dx
.Nm
driver automatically selects the best SMP-friendly and
I/O-typing queue configuration possible based on what the controller
supports.
It uses a direct disk device API which bypasses CAM, so kernel code paths
to read and write blocks are SMP-friendly and, depending on the queue
configuration, potentially conflict-free.
The driver is capable of submitting commands and processing responses on
multiple queues simultaniously in a SMP environment.
.Pp
The driver pre-reserves DMA memory for all necessary descriptors, queue
entries, and internal driver structures, and allows for a very generous
number of queue entries (1024 x NQueues) for maximum performance.
