.Dt HAMMER 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm HAMMER
.Nd HAMMER file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd options HAMMER
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hammer_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
To mount via
.Xr fstab 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/ad0s1d[:/dev/ad1s1d:...]	/mnt hammer rw 2 0
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file system provides facilities to store file system data onto a disk device
and is intended to replace UFS as the default file system for
.Dx .
Among its features are fine grained history retention, file systems spanning
multiple volumes, mirroring capability, and pseudo file systems.
.Pp
All functions related to managing
.Nm
file systems are provided by the
.Xr newfs_hammer 8 ,
.Xr mount_hammer 8 ,
.Xr hammer 8 ,
and
.Xr undo 1
utilities.
.Ss Transaction IDs
The
.Nm
file system uses 64 bit, hexadecimal transaction IDs to refer to historical
file or directory data.
An ID has the format
.Li 0x%016llx ,
such as
.Li 0x00000001061a8ba6 .
.Ss History & Pruning
History metadata on the media is updated with every sync operation.
Prior versions of files or directories are accessible by appending
.Li @@
and a transaction ID to the name.
Pruning a
.Nm
file system will free all unused historical records.
.Ss Snapshots
Snapshots are symbolic links to specific versions of directories or files,
prior or current.
Their data will be retained across prune operations for as long as the
symbolic link exists.
Removing the symbolic link enables the file system to reclaim the space
again.
.\".Ss Mirroring
.\".Ss Pseudo File Systems
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Preparing the file system
To create and mount a
.Nm
file system use the
.Xr newfs_hammer 8
and
.Xr mount_hammer 8
commands.
Note that all
.Nm
file systems must have a unique name on a per-machine basis.
.Bd -literal
newfs_hammer -L Home /dev/ad0s1d
mount_hammer /dev/ad0s1d /home
.Ed
.Pp
Similarly, multi volume file systems can be created and mounted by
specifying additional arguments.
.Bd -literal
newfs_hammer -L MultiHome /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d
mount_hammer /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d /home
.Ed
.Pp
Once created and mounted,
.Nm
file systems need to be reblocked periodically in order not to fill up
over time, either manually or with a
.Xr cron 8
job.
It is recommended that the
.Xr hammer 8
utility's
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
options be used for this job (for example, every night at 2:15 up to 5
minutes).
.Bd -literal
15 2 * * * hammer -c /var/run/Home -t 300 reblock /home >/dev/null 2>&1
.Ed
.Ss Snapshots
The
.Xr hammer 8
utility's
.Ar snapshot
command provides several ways of taking snapshots.
They all assume a directory where snapshots are kept.
.Bd -literal
mkdir /snaps
hammer snapshot /home /snaps/snap1
